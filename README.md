# Employee_Burnout_Analysis_and_Prediction_AI


The problem at hand is to analyze and predict employee burnout within an organization. The objective is to develop a model that can assess the likelihood of burnout for individual employees based on various factors such as workload, work-life balance, job satisfaction, organizational support, and personal characteristics.
